# **Medical Imaging Annotation Portfolio**

## **Chest X-Ray Pathology Annotation**

Dataset Annotator: Anita Aigbomodion

Role: Medical Imaging Data Annotator

Completion Date: December 2025





### **About This Project**

This portfolio showcases my work annotating chest X-rays across five clinically important pathologies. Each condition has 10 carefully annotated images exported in COCO format with polygon segmentation, a standard used in medical AI development.



Pathologies Covered:

Pericardial Effusion (fluid around the heart)

Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)

Pleural Effusion (fluid in chest cavity)

Bronchopneumonia (patchy lung infection)

Lobar Pneumonia (complete lobe infection)



This work demonstrates my understanding of chest X-ray interpretation, attention to clinical detail, and ability to create production-ready medical imaging datasets.





##### **What is Included**

This portfolio contains:



1\. Portfolio Documentation folder

\- This README file

\- Annotated samples which includes;

&nbsp; - 15\_annotated\_samples

&nbsp; - samples\_before\_and\_after

\- Annotation guidelines (my methodology)

\- Workflow screenshots showing my annotation process

\- Edge cases and quality assurance file



2\. Five pathology folders (one for each condition)

\- Each folder has 10 annotated X-ray images

\- COCO JSON annotation files

\- Label Studio configuration

\- Readme.md







##### **How This Dataset Can Be Used**

For AI/ML Development: The COCO JSON files can be directly loaded into frameworks like PyTorch, Detectron2, or MONAI for model training and validation.



For Portfolio Review: Recruiters and hiring managers can review the annotations to assess my medical imaging expertise and attention to detail.



For Clinical Validation: Healthcare professionals can evaluate the clinical accuracy of the pathology identification and boundary delineation.



For Research: The dataset follows standard radiological criteria and can support medical imaging research projects.







##### **My Annotation Approach**

Clinical Foundation: I annotated based on established radiological criteria, not just visual appearance. Each pathology was evaluated for its characteristic features and differentiated from similar-looking conditions.

Quality Over Speed: Rather than rushing through cases, I took time to properly identify anatomical boundaries, trace accurate polygons, and review my work for consistency.

Differential Diagnosis: For each case, I considered what else the finding could represent (mimics) and confirmed the correct diagnosis before annotating.

Professional Standards: All annotations follow medical imaging industry standards and are compatible with common AI development workflows.







##### **Technical Details**

Annotation Tool: Label Studio

Format: COCO JSON (industry standard for object detection and segmentation)

Annotation Types: Polygon segmentation with auto-generated bounding boxes

Image Quality: High-resolution chest X-rays (PA and some AP views)

Data Privacy: All images are de-identified and from publicly available sources







##### **Skills Demonstrated**

Chest X-ray interpretation and pathology recognition

Precise medical image annotation with polygon tools

Understanding of anatomical boundaries and radiological landmarks

Knowledge of differential diagnosis in chest imaging

Proficiency with annotation software (Label Studio)

Ability to work with industry-standard formats (COCO JSON)

Attention to detail and quality control

Documentation and methodology development





##### **Image Sources \& Ethics**

All images used in this portfolio are: From publicly available, open-source medical imaging datasets

Fully de-identified with no patient information

Used for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only
