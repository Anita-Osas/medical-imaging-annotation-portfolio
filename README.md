# Medical Imaging Annotation Portfolio
## Chest X-Ray Pathology Annotation for Healthcare AI

---

## About This Project

As a Registered Nurse transitioning into Healthcare AI, I completed a structured medical imaging annotation project involving 50 chest X-ray images covering common thoracic pathologies.

This project demonstrates my ability to combine clinical reasoning, anatomical knowledge, and technical annotation skills to produce medically accurate training data suitable for computer vision applications in healthcare.

All images were sourced from publicly available, fully de-identified datasets and annotated using industry-standard annotation tools and workflows.

Role Target: Medical Imaging Annotator | Clinical Data Annotator  
Focus Areas: Chest X-ray annotation, clinical imaging QA  
Availability: Immediate | Remote

## Pathologies Annotated

| Pathology | Images Annotated | Annotation Type |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Pneumonia (Lobar) | 10 | Segmentation masks (polygon-based) + classification |
| Pneumonia (Bronchial) | 10 | Segmentation masks (polygon-based) + classification |
| Pneumothorax | 10 | Polyline annotations |
| Pleural Effusion | 10 | Segmentation masks |
| Pericardial Effusion | 10 | Bounding boxes |

Total: 50 images with 80 individual annotations (approximate)

## Tools & Technologies

- Label Studio – Primary annotation platform   

---

## Annotation Workflow

### 1. Image Assessment
- Review image metadata and available context  
- Assess image quality (positioning, exposure, artifacts)  
- Identify key thoracic anatomical landmarks  

### 2. Pathology Identification
- Perform systematic chest X-ray review  
- Apply clinical reasoning to identify abnormal findings  
- Use standardized radiology terminology  

### 3. Annotation Application
- Apply appropriate annotation type (bounding boxes, segmentation masks, classification)
- Assign severity and structured attributes where applicable 
- Maintain consistent labeling conventions  
- Ensure anatomical and pathological accuracy  

### 4. Quality Assurance
- Self-review for completeness and precision  
- Spot-check annotations for consistency  
- Document ambiguous findings and edge cases  

### 5. Documentation
- Log annotations and decisions in tracking spreadsheets  
- Record QA observations and corrections  
- Maintain reproducible annotation guidelines

## Key Outcomes

- Consistent annotation quality across all images
- Correct application of multiple annotation types
- Clinically informed severity grading using defined radiographic criteria
- Inclusion of structured clinical attributes beyond primary pathology labels
- Structured QA process with documented edge cases
- All data handled using HIPAA-compliant, de-identified sources

## Annotation Summary

- Total images annotated: 50  
- Total annotations: ~80 (approximate)  
- Average time per image: ~12 minutes  
- Annotation types used:  
  - Bounding boxes  
  - Segmentation masks (polygon-based, for selected pathologies)  
  - Classification labels (used where appropriate)
  - Severity labels
  - Structured clinical attributes

## Limitations & Scope

This portfolio project was designed to demonstrate clinical annotation skills and workflow discipline, rather than to represent a large-scale production dataset.

Scope
- Focused annotation of 50 chest X-ray images
- Coverage of common thoracic pathologies
- Explicit severity grading using defined radiographic thresholds
- Inclusion of structured clinical attributes such as air bronchograms, meniscus sign, vascular markings, and tracheal deviation
- Annotations performed by a single annotator (self)  
- Intended primarily for portfolio and skill demonstration purposes  

Limitations
- No formal inter-annotator agreement (IAA) metrics calculated  
- Annotation counts and statistics are approximate  
- Dataset size is not sufficient for standalone model training  
- Image interpretation performed without access to full clinical reports  

Despite these limitations, the project reflects real-world annotation practices and demonstrates readiness to contribute effectively to larger, collaborative healthcare AI annotation projects.

---

## Future Improvements

Given additional time and resources, this project could be expanded by:

- Increasing dataset size to include a broader range of thoracic and non-thoracic conditions  
- Incorporating multi-annotator workflows and calculating inter-annotator agreement metrics  
- Refining and standardizing severity thresholds across additional pathologies
- Expanding structured clinical attributes for richer downstream modeling
- Participating in annotation QA cycles under radiologist or senior reviewer supervision
